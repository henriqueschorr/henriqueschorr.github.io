# Issues to Work

## Character Creation

## Learning Curve

## Checks

## Damage

## Combat

1. **One of the players was kind of lost without turn order**

I need more tests.

2. **What about players stopped in time?**
Others took more actions when he just sat there watching

I need more tests.

3. **What if player is stunned and the other players just continue to succeed?**

I need more tests.

## Resources

## Classes

1. **Engineer overwhelming during creation**

Need more tests

2. **Scout lots its assassin identity when soldier killed everyone**

I'm not sure how to fix/if this need fix. Need more tests.

## Abilities

1. **Confusion between scientist abilities and chemicals**

I think it was just first player commentary. More tests needed.

2. **The abilities were underwhelming for its resource cost/availability**

I need more data for this. Make it clear that it is survival.

3. **Engineer abilities were not used**

I think this was because of the overwhelming factor. Also, the player did not confront monsters.  
More tests.
