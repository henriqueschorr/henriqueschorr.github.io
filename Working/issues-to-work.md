# Issues to Work

## Character Creation

1. **Confusion when creating character**
   1. 2 thought it easy
   2. The engineer found confusing
   3. The scout said that the cheats were already filled (?)

I believe that the character creation will be easier with better sheet, cards and steps presentation.

## Learning Curve

Nothing to comment, they thought it good and easy.

## Checks

1. **Complain about the dice system**
   1. too much luck, should have more modifiers from character
   2. It should be more clear on what a character is good and not, dice is too much luck

I believe this is a misconception.  
In BTH, you can already have 62,5% success chance with a d8 in 2 different attributes since level 1.

In D&D, you would need the following to achieve more than 60% chance (65%):

| DC  | Modifier | ~Level | ~Sessions |
| --- | -------- | ------ | --------- |
| 12  | +5       | ~4     | ~4        |
| 14  | +7       | ~8     | ~10       |
| 17  | +10      | ~12    | ~25       |
| 19  | +12      | ~17    | ~500      |

Some campaings don't even reach these levels.

In BTH you can achieve 70% and 75% success chance with d10 and d12, respectively. This is less than you can achieve in D&D with a medium/high level character making a check against DC12 (90%) and DC14 (80%). But, we can also imply that a medium/high level character should not be making DC12 checks; sometimes, a DC14 check could appear.

The impact of Advantage is bigger in D&D than the +1/+2 difficulty modifiers from BTH. But the same can be said about the Disadvantage x -1/-2 BTH modifiers.

In conclusion, the probability of BTH looks like it is in a good place.

2. **Too much Control checks (weapons)**

I think the issue here is based solely when looking at the humans, which mostly will use ranged weapons based on Control. When you have the full picture, more species and abilities will use other Attributes.

## Damage

1. **Static Damage**
   1. should dice be rolled for extra damage?

I want to make combat as quick as possible. One of the ways to achieve this, is to make few dice rolls and complicated math.  
Also, the static extra damage makes it easier to create monsters and prepare encounters.

## Combat

1. **The monsters were weak**
   1. PCs killed everything before they had a chance to act

I think that the health and damage of the monsters were in a good place, however, the action economy was not. There were the following issues that contributed to this:

- The grenade dealt too much damage
- The players had too much luck on rolls (?)
- I forgot that I could act when partial success
- I forgot to take tokens for some actions
- The chemicals were too good and easy to make

This can be better observed by the probabilities that the GM has to intercept the party turn:

| Die | Failure (1-3) | Partial Success (4-7) | Total  |
| --- | ------------- | --------------------- | ------ |
| d6  | 50%           | 50%                   | 100%   |
| d8  | 37.50%        | 50%                   | 87.50% |
| d10 | 30%           | 40%                   | 70%    |
| d12 | 25%           | 33.33%                | 58.33% |

2. **What if players just continue to succeed and the GM has no chance to play?**

This should not be a problem as shown above. The issue was the strong abilities and the GM forgetting to intercept play.

3. **One of the players was kind of lost without turn order**

I need more tests.

4. **What about players stopped in time?**
   1. Others took more actions when he just sat there watching

I need more tests.

5. **What if player is stunned and the other players just continue to succeed?**

I need more tests.

## Resources

1. **Too little Chaos**

I think that the chaos availability is good, the bigger issue was the underwhelming abilities (?).  
I believe that I need more tests with this. Also, make it clear that it is more survival based.

## Classes

1. **Scientist too good**

   - Change "can make chemicals on the go" to a scientist ability costing chaos
   - Chemicals now have resistance checks

2. **Engineer overwhelming during creation**

   - Unify "Mode: Forge" and "Connection" in one unique move card about the drone

3. **Engineer bad compared to scientist**

Making the chemicals weaker should improve this.

4. **Scout lost its stealth identity when everyone had access to camouflage**

   - Move the "Camouflage" ability to Scout A.N.E. only (earns the skill, not choice)

5. **Scout lots its assassin identity when soldier killed everyone**

I'm not sure how to fix/if this need fix. Need more tests.

## Abilities

1. **Confusion between scientist abilities and chemicals**

I think it was just first player commentary.

2. **The abilities were underwhelming for its resource cost/availability**

I need more data for this. Make it clear that it is survival.

3. **The card presentation was bad, it was not clear about the chaos cost**

New model should make it more clear.

4. **Stealth was broken without limitations**

Already added limitation.

5. **Chemicals without reistance checks were broken**

Already added resistance checks to chemicals.

6. **Engineer abilities were not used**

I think this was because of the overwhelming factor. Also, the player did not confront monsters.
