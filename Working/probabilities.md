## Summary

In my system, BTH, you can have 62,5% success probability in 2 different attributes from the 1st level. If you want to achieve more than 60% probability in D&D, for a DC14, you will need to be around the 5th level.

Now, what about easy tasks in medium level (level 11-16)?  
Considering that DC14 is easy for high level characters, and +8 is the modifier, you would have 70% success rate. The same could be achieved with a character of 3rd level in BTH.  
If you want to make it easier, you could give +1 or +2 modifiers, giving a total of 80% and 90% respectively for a d10 attribute; which is less than the 96.88% given by the D&D advantage, but still good.
